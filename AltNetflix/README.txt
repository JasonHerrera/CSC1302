Dr. Sunderraman,

OverallMean.java, ProbeAnswers.java, and Netflix1.java use the command line parameters you assigned.

I wrote MovieMeans.java, CustomerMeans.java, Netflix2.java, Netflix3.java, and Netflix4.java so that they do not use command line parameters.

I hope that clarifies how to use the programs I wrote.

Sincerely,
Jason Herrera
